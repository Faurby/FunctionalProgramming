(* Question 1.3 *)

    (* 
    Q: Why are the higher-order functions from the List library 
    not a good fit to implement insert?

    In the insert function we have two base cases, the empty list and if the
    element fits into a given spot.
    Higher order function does not support this. Higher order functions does not
    support not itterating through the whole list. We do not have a way of
    returning in the middle of a fold
