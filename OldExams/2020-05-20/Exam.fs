(* If you are importing this into F# interactive then comment out
   the line above and remove the comment for the line bellow.

   Do note that the project will not compile if you do this, but 
   it does allow you to work in interactive mode and you can just remove the '=' 
   to make the project compile work again.

   Do not remove the line (even though that does work) because you may inadvertantly
   introduce indentation errors in your code that may be hard to find if you want
   to switch back to project mode. 

   Alternative, keep the line as is, but load ExamInteractive.fsx into the interactive environment
